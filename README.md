I have completed a coursera certification course.
Please find [Certificate](https://coursera.org/share/9b84d580a2f9f8a178b9a943ea55d852)

1. Forecasting_Tesla_stocks_prophet.ipynb
This file consist of codes to download one year Tesla stock data from Yahoo finance using url and pandas and use it to forecase 30 days using FB-Prophet.

2. Forecasting_Automation.ipynb
This is an attempt in automating the stock prediction file. In this we only need to change the url.

Future:
I will try to make it to collect data using yfinance module and ticker. So that only Ticker name is sufficient for whole process.
